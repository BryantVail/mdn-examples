//Using CSS Animations
    Animations: 
        1. style
        2. keyframe set for start, end, and other specified 'waypoints'
    advantages: 
        1. easy to use for simple animations, 
        2. run well- 
            a. even under moderate system load or resource availability. 
            b. 'frame skipping'; rendering engine can use 'frame skipping' & other techniques to keep performance smooth. 
        3. browser reduces burden on the system. 
            a. reduces the frequency of animations in tabs that aren't visible or in use. 
    Configure the Animation: 
        1. animation property: 
            a. style the element to be animated
                i. 'timing', 'duration', other details
            b. this does NOT config the actual appearance
                i. @keyframes does this 
            c. Sub-Properties: 
                1. animation-name
                    i. describes the name of the @keyframes at-rule 
                2. animation-duration 
                    i. seconds commonly
                3. animation-timing-function
                    i. acceleration curves
                4. animation-delay 
                5. animation-iteration-count 
                    i. repeat count 
                    ii. 'infinite' is a static value 
                6. animation-direction
                    i. specifies whether the animation direction should alternate
                7. animation-fill-mode: 
                    i. values that are applied by the animation before & after its executing
                8. animation-play-state
                    i. pause & resume animation sequence

        2. Example: 
            .main-box{
                overflow: hidden;
                width: 100vw;
            }

            p.slide-text{
                animation-name: slide-text-in;
                animation-duration: 3s;
            }

            @keyframes slide-text-in{
                0% {
                    /* hides the content off the edge of the page */
                    margin-left: 100%;
                    /* makes the content much longer than the width of the window */
                    width: 300%;
                }

                100% {
                    margin-left: 0%;
                    width: 100%;
                }
            }

multiple-animation-property-values: {

    /* all named animations will have the same duration when there's only One value */
    animation-name: fade-in-out, move-left-300px, bounce;
    animation-duration: 3s;
    animation-iteration-count: 1;

    /*3 values for 3 named animations */
    animation-name: fade-in-out, move-left-300px, bounce;
    animation-duration: 2.5s, 5s, 1s;
    animation-iteration-count: 2,1,5;
